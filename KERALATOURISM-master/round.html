                The Department of Tourism is a major government ministry under the Kerala Government that regulates and supervises tourism in Kerala. Kerala Tourism is ranked as one of the fastest growing tourism industry in the country and the ministry has been often adjudged as key department that aggressively worked on to make Kerala Tourism into Top 100 Superbrands.
                
                Government of Kerala trended to ignore its tourism potential completely until the late 1980s, despite the strong marketing efforts done by leading private tour agencies. This even forced WTTC, often referring Kerala as a late-comer to the tourism sector. Unlike other departments, Tourism Department is considered as independent department and a field agency. It has its headquarters located at Park View, in Thiruvananthapuram. The Department is headed by a minister, supported by a Principal secretary. In addition the department has a director and 2 additional directors. There is a council consisting of key tourist players and government officials, which advises the government.
